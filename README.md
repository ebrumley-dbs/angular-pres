# Angular presentation

**Prerequisites for working with the "before" code sample:**

  * Node.js and npm are essential to Angular 2 development.

  * Get them NOW if they are not already installed on your machine.
  
  * Verify that you are running at least node v4.x.x and npm 3.x.x by running node -v and npm -v in a terminal/console window. Older versions produce errors.

  * IntelliJ or WebStorm are preferred.
